As the maintainer of this project, I am committed to fairly enforcing this Code of Conduct. If you experience or witness behavior that violates these guidelines, please report it to **dev@bastndev.com**

**Important: Email Subject Line Format**

**When contacting the maintainer, please include the project name in your email subject line using this format:**

**Examples:**
