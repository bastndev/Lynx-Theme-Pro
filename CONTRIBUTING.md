## Submitting Your Contribution 🎯

### Pull Request Requirements

When creating your PR, please include:

1. **Clear description** of what you've added/changed
2. **Theme information** (if adding a new theme):
   - Theme name
   - UI theme type: `vs-dark` (dark themes) or `vs` (light themes)
   - Brief description of the theme's style/inspiration

3. **Screenshots** (highly recommended):
   - Show your theme/icons in action
   - Include examples with different programming languages

### Testing Checklist

Before submitting, please test with:
- ✅ **TypeScript** files  
- ✅ **Python** files
- ✅ **Rust** files
- ✅ **Dart** files
- ✅ Different UI elements (sidebar, editor, terminal)
- ✅ Both file explorer and code syntax highlighting

## Important Notes ⚠️

### What NOT to Modify

- **`package.json`** - Only the maintainer updates this file for version releases and theme registration

### Code Formatting

When creating themes, please respect the existing structure and formatting. The project uses `.prettierignore` to maintain the specific formatting of theme files, so your themes won't be auto-formatted and will preserve their intended structure.

### Branch Strategy

- **Work in**: `dev` branch only
- **Submit PRs to**: `dev` branch
- The maintainer will merge `dev` → `main` for releases
